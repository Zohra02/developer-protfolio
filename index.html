        <h3> Life Mean Body Buidling</h3>
        <p> Bodybuilding needs discipline, effort, and a lot of motivation. They call it the "grind" or the "hustle" but the bottom line remains the same - that in order to have a heavy body, you need to be ready to put in the work and start to lift heavy. However, this motivation may be hard to find because of various reasons, but one should never lose hope. The true victory of a bodybuilder is to keep going even when the world thinks he is defeated, and these quotes on bodybuilding will help you do just that. ‍</p>

            <p> He is Md Shohag. He is my good buddy. Friendship is a divine relationship. We don’t have similarities in our blood, but still, that person cares for us. Irrespective of all differences, a friend chooses you, understands you, and supports you. Whenever you are in self-doubt or lacking confidence, talk to a friend, and your worry will surely go away.</p>
